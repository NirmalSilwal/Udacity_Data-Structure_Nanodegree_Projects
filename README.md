Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program! 

---

In this repository, I will be adding all the projects I did while doing this program from Udacity.

At its core, this program is about how to write code to solve problems and to do so efficiently.

You're probably well aware that computers can be used to solve all sorts of problems—from calculating the fastest route on a map, to sequencing the human genome. But there is almost always more than one way to solve a problem, and some ways can be dramatically more efficient than others. Two approaches may solve the same problem, but one may take milliseconds, while the other takes hours.

***
How do you look at a problem and identify different ways that you could solve it? And how do you know which approaches are more or less efficient? Will your solution run quickly or slowly? Will it take up a lot of space in the computer's memory, or only a little? Being able to answer these kinds of questions will make you a more effective developer—and also help you perform much better during technical interviews.

The key to mastering these skills is practice. Simply hearing about algorithms and data structures will not make you proficient at analyzing or implementing them in a real-world situation. For that reason, our goal in this program is not only to explain key concepts, but also to give you lots of chances to practice the key skills through hands-on exercises.
